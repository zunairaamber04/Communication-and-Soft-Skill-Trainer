# Communication-and-Soft-Skill-Trainer
## Overview 
Communication and Presentation skills play a very crucial role in employability and personal growth. However, students often lack real-time feedback on how they speak, express themselves, or maintain confidence during interviews and presentations. 
This **AI-Based Communication and Soft skill Trainer** aims to create a **personalized, AI powered coach** that analyzes a student's **speech, tone, facial expression, posture, and eye contact** to provide a structured feedback and improvement recommendations.
This project stimulates a **Virtual Communication Lab**, helping users build self-awareness, confidence, and clarity through AI-driven evaluation and guided practice.
## Setup 
1.Capture and analyze student communication via video or webcam input.
2.Evaluate **verbal, non-verbal**, and **visual cues**[facial expression, posture, tone, vocabulary].
3.Generate an overall **communication score** with detailed feedback by category.
4.Provide **AI-driven suggestions** for improvements.
5.Enable a **dashboard interface** to view progress, history, and comparative performance.
6.Deliver an MVP within 4 weeks with real-time analysis and basic feedback.
